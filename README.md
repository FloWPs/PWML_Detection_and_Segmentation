# PWML Detection and Segmentation Software for pediatricians

Regarding tool availability, the Python implementation of the training and evaluation codes for the complete pipeline is currently accessible at [github.com/FloWPs/CACTUS](). Additionally, the pipeline has also been integrated into an automatic PWML detection and segmentation software, freely available on the VIP web platform [vip.creatis.insa-lyon.fr]().

This simplifies volume pre-processing, testing and visualization of PWML on ultrasound volumes in a user-friendly way for physicians in hospitals or pediatric units, thus paving the way for a better integration of AI algorithms in clinical settings.
